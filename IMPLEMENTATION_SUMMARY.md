# Roles and Permissions System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system has been successfully implemented for Worklane. The system provides flexible, multi-level permissions with support for custom roles and per-project permission overrides.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

**File**: `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`

Added the following models:

- `Organization` - Multi-tenant support
- `OrganizationMember` - User membership in organizations with roles
- `Role` - Predefined and custom roles
- `Permission` - Granular permissions (21 total)
- `RolePermission` - Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions
- `Project` - Projects within organizations
- `ProjectMember` - Project membership with role overrides
- `ProjectMemberPermission` - Custom permissions per project member (overrides)
- `Task` - Tasks within projects
- `TaskAssignment` - Task assignments to users
- `AuditLog` - Tracks all permission changes

**Key Features**:

- Support for system roles (can't be deleted) and custom roles
- Per-project permission overrides (same role, different permissions per project)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Permission Constants

**File**: `apps/web/lib/permissions/constants.ts`

Defined:

- **7 Organization Permissions**: MANAGE_ORGANIZATION, MANAGE_USERS, MANAGE_BILLING, MANAGE_ROLES, VIEW_AUDIT_LOG, INVITE_MEMBERS, REMOVE_MEMBERS
- **6 Project Permissions**: CREATE_PROJECT, EDIT_PROJECT, DELETE_PROJECT, VIEW_PROJECT, MANAGE_PROJECT_MEMBERS, ARCHIVE_PROJECT
- **8 Task Permissions**: CREATE_TASK, EDIT_TASK, DELETE_TASK, VIEW_TASK, ASSIGN_TASK, CHANGE_TASK_STATUS, COMMENT_TASK, EDIT_TASK_PRIORITY
- **6 System Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN, ORG_ADMIN, PROJECT_MANAGER, TEAM_LEAD, MEMBER, VIEWER
- Default permission mappings for each role
- Helper functions for permission categorization

### 3. Permission Checking Utilities

**File**: `apps/web/lib/permissions/check.ts`

Implemented functions:

- `hasOrgPermission()` - Check organization-level permissions
- `hasProjectPermission()` - Check project-level permissions with override support
- `hasTaskPermission()` - Check task-level permissions
- `getUserOrgRole()` - Get user's organization role
- `getUserProjectRole()` - Get user's project role
- `getUserPermissions()` - Get all permissions for a user in a context
- `canAccessResource()` - Universal permission check
- `isOrgMember()` / `isProjectMember()` - Membership checks
- `getUserOrganizations()` / `getUserProjects()` - Get user's organizations and projects

### 4. Permission Middleware

**File**: `apps/web/lib/permissions/middleware.ts`

Created higher-order functions for API route protection:

- `requireOrgPermission()` - Protect organization-level routes
- `requireProjectPermission()` - Protect project-level routes
- `requireTaskPermission()` - Protect task-level routes
- `requireAnyPermission()` - Check multiple permissions
- `requireAuth()` - Simple authentication check

### 5. Database Seed Script

**File**: `apps/web/prisma/seed-permissions.ts`

Seeds:

- All 21 permissions with descriptions and categories
- 6 system roles with default permissions
- Demo organization
- Copies system roles to demo organization
- Assigns existing users to demo organization as Super Admin
- Creates demo project
- Adds users to demo project as Project Manager

**Command**: `pnpm db:seed-permissions`

### 6. React Hooks

**File**: `apps/web/hooks/use-permissions.ts`

Client-side hooks:

- `useHasPermission()` - Check if current user has a permission
- `useUserRole()` - Get current user's role
- `useCanAccess()` - Check resource access
- `usePermissions()` - Get all permissions for current user
- `useUserOrganizations()` - Get user's organizations
- `useUserProjects()` - Get user's projects

### 7. UI Components

**File**: `apps/web/components/permissions/can.tsx`

Permission-based rendering component:

```tsx
<Can permission={OrgPermission.MANAGE_USERS} orgId={orgId}>
  <button>Manage Users</button>
</Can>
```

### 8. API Routes

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Multi-Level Permissions

- Organization-level permissions (global)
- Project-level permissions (project-specific)
- Task-level permissions (task-specific)

### ✅ Flexible Role System

- 6 predefined system roles
- Support for custom roles
- Role-based permission assignment

### ✅ Per-Project Permission Overrides

- Same user role can have different permissions in different projects
- Granular control: grant or revoke specific permissions per project
- Example: Project Manager can delete tasks in Project A but not in Project B

### ✅ Audit Logging

- Tracks all role and permission changes
- Records who made changes and when
- Stores metadata for context

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Support

- Organizations as tenant containers
- Projects belong to organizations
- Users can be members of multiple organizations

### ✅ Complete API Coverage

- Full CRUD for roles
- Full CRUD for organization members
- Full CRUD for project members
- Permission checking endpoints

### ✅ Frontend Integration

- React hooks for permission checks
- Permission-based UI rendering component
- Session integration with NextAuth.js

## Usage Examples

### Backend: Check Permission

```typescript
import { hasProjectPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/check";
import { ProjectPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/constants";

const canEdit = await hasProjectPermission(
  userId,
  projectId,
  ProjectPermission.EDIT_PROJECT
);
```

### Backend: Protect API Route

```typescript
import { requireProjectPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/middleware";
import { ProjectPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/constants";

export async function PUT(req: NextRequest) {
  return requireProjectPermission(ProjectPermission.EDIT_PROJECT)(
    req,
    async (req, userId) => {
      // Protected logic here
    }
  );
}
```

### Frontend: Permission-Based Rendering

```tsx
import { Can } from "@/components/permissions/can";
import { ProjectPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/constants";

<Can permission={ProjectPermission.EDIT_PROJECT} projectId={projectId}>
  <button>Edit Project</button>
</Can>;
```

### Frontend: Use Hook

```tsx
import { useHasPermission } from "@/hooks/use-permissions";
import { TaskPermission } from "@/lib/permissions/constants";

const canDelete = useHasPermission(TaskPermission.DELETE_TASK, { projectId });
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Generate Prisma Client**

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

2. **Push Schema to Database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```

3. **Seed Permissions and Roles**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:seed-permissions
   ```

4. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   pnpm build
   ```

## Testing the System

After seeding:

1. All existing users are assigned to "Demo Organization" as Super Admin
2. A "Demo Project" is created
3. All users are added to the demo project as Project Manager
4. You can test permission checks using the API endpoints
5. You can create custom roles and test permission overrides

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the permissions system:

1. **Create UI for Role Management**
   - Admin page to view/create/edit roles
   - Permission matrix UI component
   - Role assignment interface

2. **Create UI for Member Management**
   - Organization member management page
   - Project member management page
   - Custom permission assignment UI

3. **Implement Task Management**
   - Task CRUD operations
   - Task assignment with permission checks
   - Task status updates with permission checks

4. **Add Permission Guards to Existing Routes**
   - Update middleware to check permissions
   - Add permission checks to all API routes
   - Protect UI elements based on permissions

5. **Enhance Audit Logging**
   - Audit log viewer UI
   - Filtering and search
   - Export functionality
